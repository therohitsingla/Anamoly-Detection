# PyCaret Anomaly Detection Tutorial

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the use of **PyCaret** for anomaly detection. PyCaret is a low-code machine learning library in Python designed to automate machine learning workflows, enabling faster and more efficient experimentation. It wraps several popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and others into a unified framework.

Compared with other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret allows replacing hundreds of lines of code with just a few, making it highly efficient for experimentation. PyCaret is particularly useful for **citizen data scientists**, empowering users with limited technical expertise to perform sophisticated analytical tasks.

## Installation

Depending on your use-case, you can install specific variants:
- Analysis: `pip install pycaret[analysis]`
- Models: `pip install pycaret[models]`
- Tuner: `pip install pycaret[tuner]`
- MLOps: `pip install pycaret[mlops]`
- Parallel Processing: `pip install pycaret[parallel]`
- Testing: `pip install pycaret[test]`

## Notebook Content

### Steps Covered:
1. **Importing Libraries and Modules:**
   - `pycaret.anomaly` for anomaly detection workflows.
   - `pycaret.datasets` to load sample datasets.

2. **Dataset Loading:**
   Sample datasets are loaded using PyCaret's built-in utilities.

3. **Model Setup and Training:**
